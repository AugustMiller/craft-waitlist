# Craft Waitlist

> **Please Note**
> This plugin is under active development. Some primary advertised features are not yet implemented.

A client recently requested that customers be able to sign up for notifications after a product had sold out. We decided to use the opportunity to extract the functionality into a plugin.

Essentially, the plugin exposes a single endpoint that accepts an AJAX `POST` payload with an email address and product ID. The "members" created via that public controller are fed into an element index, and can be moved between three pre-defined statuses (still in flux).

Ultimately, another element action will allow members to be selected in bulk and delivered a customized notification.

The plugin will not automatically send notifications, as control is inherently limitedâ€”updating or restoring inventory should be done independently, and never directly or inadvertently trigger emails.

The form can be as simple as this, assuming it's submitted via AJAX:

```twig
<form method="POST" class="waitlist">
  <input type="hidden" name="action" value="waitlist/members/add">
  <input type="hidden" name="subjectId" value="{{ product.id }}">
  {{ getCsrfInput() }}

  <input type="text" name="email">
  <input type="submit" value="Sign up for notifications">
</form>
```

A basic but configurable honeypot is planned to reduce spam submissions.

Of course, you could do this just as easily with a basic Mailchimp list. This is intended as a strictly marketing tool, and not as a means to build a contact list. Emails are apt to get purged after notifications are sent.
